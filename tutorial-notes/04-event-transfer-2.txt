    Set movement route - this Event
    Skip if cannot move
    Uncheck wait for completion
    Move right x 4

Create MovingGuy NPC walks alongside
    Same as above - man one tile above "I'm going to walk with that lady"
    Open woman event. Copy and paste the movement and change "this event" to MovingGuy

They should both walk 4 tiles at the same time when you talk to them.
They will be blocked after talkingt to them a few times but they will keep saying the same thing.
